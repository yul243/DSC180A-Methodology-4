**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

I found causal discovery using large language models particularly interesting. It's fascinating how natural language prompts can guide the selection of causal graphs automatically.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

I'd like to explore causal relationships between macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth, and consumer spending patterns.

**3 .What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

I'd focus on improving data preprocessing and causal validation metrics to ensure stronger interpretability and elss noise in causal inference outputs.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

I'd like to incorporate graph neural networks (GNNs) and compare their inferred causal edges with traditional constrains-based methods.
